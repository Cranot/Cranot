## Hey, I'm Dimitris

Self-taught programmer from Greece. I build things that scratch an itch — from high-performance C++ data structures to AI-powered tools and full-stack web apps.

I call myself a **CosmoHacker**: someone whose actions are meant to make someone else's life a bit better. That's the thread through everything I build.

### Research & Original Work

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **[grouped-simd-hashtable](https://github.com/Cranot/grouped-simd-hashtable)** | High-performance C++ hash table using grouped SIMD metadata scanning. Beats SOTA at scale. |
| **[tieredsort](https://github.com/Cranot/tieredsort)** | Header-only C++17 sorting library. 3.6x faster than `std::sort`, up to 21x on dense data. |
| **[chameleon-cache](https://github.com/Cranot/chameleon-cache)** | Variance-aware cache replacement policy that beats TinyLFU by +5.09pp through the Basin of Leniency. |
| **[mzip](https://github.com/Cranot/mzip)** | Detection-based compression: 32KB for 1MB of sequential IDs (32768x). Store the formula, not the data. |

### AI & Tools

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **[claude-code-guide](https://github.com/Cranot/claude-code-guide)** | The complete Claude Code CLI guide. Live & auto-updated every 2 days. 2300+ stars. |
| **[deep-research](https://github.com/Cranot/deep-research)** | Turn any question into multi-agent exploration. Recursive Claude agents that spawn sub-agents. |
| **[AgentsKB.com](https://agentskb.com)** | Knowledge base for AI agents, tools, and workflows. |
